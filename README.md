### Classification Exercises

This repository contains a collection of small classification projects. Each project focuses on the following steps:

* Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing datasets for analysis.
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Investigating relationships and visualizing data to gain insights.
* Modeling: Applying various classification models to the data.
* Performance Evaluation: Utilizing ROC curves, AUC, precision-recall curves, and learning curves to evaluate model performance.
* Error Analysis: Conducting detailed error analysis to understand model shortcomings.
* Predictions: Making predictions based on the developed models.

These projects aim to explore different aspects of classification, from data preparation to detailed performance analysis.
